                        That inspired Imagineers to create a companion to Duffy—his best friend, ShellieMay. 
                        Based on the pair's increasing popularity, Imagineers decided to develop an entire collection of characters, 
                        each with a distinct personality and talent: artistic cat friend, Gelatoni, dancing rabbit friend, StellaLou, 
                        inventive dog friend, CookieAnn, and musical turtle friend, 'Olu Mel. </td>

                        Curious about everything, CookieAnn’s inventions go beyond culinary creations. She has fun conjuring up out-of-the-box solutions to problems by combining different ideas. 
                        Additionally, with her acute olfactory ability, she is able to smell “unsavory” happenings!</td>

                        Almost everything done at Imagineering starts with story. This particular story goes…when Mickey Mouse the sailor, 
                        based in Cape Cod, was leaving on a long sea voyage, Minnie Mouse made Duffy to keep Mickey company during his travels. 
                        Minnie presented her hand-sewn bear to Mickey in a duffel bag, which is how Mickey came up with the name Duffy. 
                        But stories can evolve, and as Duffy's story has evolved, he and Mickey have visited many exciting places together, 
                        meeting new friends along the way. With a willingness to do anything to bring a smile to his friends, and his quintessential innocence,
                         Duffy takes all of us back to our childhood when we all had an "inner Duffy."</td>

                Duffy met LinaBell when he was lost in the forest following a butterfly. LinaBell suddenly but masterfully took out her 
                magnifying glass and started examining “clues” on Duffy’s body to figure out where he had come from. Thanks to her detective-like talent, 
                Duffy was able to be reunited with Mickey Mouse. Duffy and the rest of the friends are often in awe of her ingenious ways of solving problems.
